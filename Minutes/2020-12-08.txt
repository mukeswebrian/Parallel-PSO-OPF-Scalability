Agenda
- research threshold magnitudes in real life applications Independent System Operator(ISO) or Regional Transmission Operator(RTO)
- consider impact of small perturbations to the solution: Security Constrained Economic dispatch(ED) or OPF
  - Day ahead market - 24 hours
  - Hour ahead market - 1 hour
  - Real time dispatch - ~5 minutes
  
- Review scalability preliminary results
  - Limited to one node
  - Decided to focus on MPI
- Discuss possible approach for parallelization using MPI
  - mpi4py: tested execution on Cirrus. 
  - mpi4py has adequate documentation caompared to pyMPI
- Strategy for choosing MPI topology

Discussion Notes
- starting with a simpler topology e.g broadcast better than all sending to rank 0 and then rank 0 resending data
- Test time all process to verify behaviour as expected
- Think about the overall benefits of parallelization
  - e.g to same thing faster, more in the same time, accommodate additional complexity etc
  - Looking for either a pain to be solved, or opportunity to be gained


Next meeting:
- Tuesday 5th.
