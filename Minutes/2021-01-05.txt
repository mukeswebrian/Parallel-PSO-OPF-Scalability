Agenda
- Review current MPI implementation (broadcast and gather)
- Discuss inital MPI run results
- Discuss strategies for reducing comminication overhead e.g reducing synchronization frequency

Discussion
- Attempt algorithm with more exploration, in order to take advantage of increased number of particles (varry initialization parameters)
- Minimum powerloss as a function of processes and or particles
- use a different terminating condition e.g when the particles converge
- try runs with reduced synchronization frequency
- direct comparison of parallel run with serial with the same parameters (for completeness)
- visualization of the discovered solutions

Next meeting
- Tuesday January 19th, 2021
